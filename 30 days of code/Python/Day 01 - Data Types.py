# Pre-initialised variables
i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '

# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
a = 0
b = 0.0
c = ""

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
a = int(input())
b = float(input())
c = str(input())

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line
print(i+a)

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line
print(d+b)

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
print(s+c)
# The 's' variable above should be printed first
